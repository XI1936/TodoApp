## Few Important points 
In React app we use JSX ( JavaScript syntex expression )
Used React Extension in VS code (ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native snippets)
Used Two React Hooks 
<ul>
<li>useState</li>
<li>useEffect</li>
</ul>
This to Remember in JSX below synext should be used 

class => className
for => htmlFor
a=> Link
href => to

if using mytiple div in return use <></>

You will also see any lint errors in the console.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
